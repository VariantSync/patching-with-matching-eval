/// Applies all file patches that are found in the diff file. This function also requires a path to
/// the directories of the source and target variants for the patch application, because it tries
/// to match the artifacts of the source variant with the artifacts of the target variant. The
/// calculated matching is then used to determine the best locations for a specific change to a
/// file.
///
/// This function creates new files for files that are created by a patch, and it deletes files for
/// file deletions in a patch, regardless of whether the lines in the patch match the lines in the
/// file completelty.
///
/// ## Parameters
///
/// ### source_dir_path
/// Specifies the path to the root directory of the source variant of the diff. The source variant
/// is the version of the program that was modified by the changes that are now to be applied.
///
/// ### target_dir_path
/// Specifies the path to the root directory of the target variant that is to be patched.
///
/// ### patch_file_path
/// Specifies the path to the diff that describes all changes that are to be applied. This diff
/// should usually have been determined between two versions of the source variant.
///
/// ### rejects_file_path
/// You may optionally provide a path to a rejects file to which all rejected changes are written.
/// If no path is provided, the rejects are printed to stdout.
///
/// ### strip
/// You can also define a path strip `s`. The strip is used to remove the leading `s` elements from
/// a path (e.g., the path `hello/world/directory` becomes `world/directory` for a strip of `s=1`).
/// Providing a strip is usually necessary because diffs are created based on two version of a
/// source variant that are located in different directories (e.g., `source-A/...` and
/// `source-B/...`). This top-level directory should be cut from the path for the patch being
/// applied successfully.  
///
/// ### dryrun
/// You should also specify whether the patch application should be made persistant (i.e., patched
/// files are saved), or if this is only a dryrun. In case of a dryrun, the patch application is
/// only simulated, printing all rejects to stdout without file changes.
///
/// ### matcher
/// Lastly, this function requires a matcher that is used to calculate the matching between source
/// and target variant. See `mpatch::matching` for more information.
///
// TODO: It would be great to track differences during file removal as rejects
// TODO: Improve interface of this function (e.g., make it smaller or at least more versatile)
