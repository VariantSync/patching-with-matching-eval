//! mpatch is a tool for patching files based on a matching between the source and target of the
//! patch. Its usage is similar to Unix patch as it requires a diff file as input that specifies
//! the changes which have been determined between two versions of the source variant. Currently,
//! it is assumed that the diff has been calculated using Unix diff with the recommended list of arguments
//! `-Naur`.
//!
//! The library can be used to calculate matchings between two source files, or to apply patches
//! read from a file or provided as text.
//!
//! # Examples
//! ## Patching target variants
//! You can patch a target variant using the `apply_all` function. See its documentation for more
//! information on the paramters.
//! ```
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//! use std::str::FromStr;
//! use mpatch::KeepAllFilter;
//! use mpatch::PatchPaths;
//!
//! let strip = 1;
//! let dryrun = true;
//! let matcher = mpatch::LCSMatcher;
//! let patch_paths = PatchPaths::new(
//!     PathBuf::from("tests/samples/source_variant/version-0"),
//!     PathBuf::from("tests/samples/target_variant/version-0"),
//!     PathBuf::from("tests/samples/patch.diff"),
//!     None,
//! );
//!
//! if let Err(error) = mpatch::apply_all(
//!     patch_paths,
//!     strip,
//!     dryrun,
//!     matcher,
//!     KeepAllFilter,
//! ) {
//!     eprintln!("{}", error);
//! }
//! ```
